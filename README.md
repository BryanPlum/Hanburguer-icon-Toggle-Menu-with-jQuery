"# Menu-bg-color-with-jQuery" 
Imagine a situation that you have to make a div, appear/desappear in an event "click", for responsivity. In short screen, like smartphone and tablets, you can do this with the "hamburguer" icon. Than, when you click there, it makes your menu list appear and desappear. In the index.html archive, you will find an example, linked with bootstrap. In the app.js archive, you you find the jQuery code to make its happen.

PS: This function, can also be done just with the bootstrap
